# push_swap

## Description

**push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations and the smallest possible number of moves.

The project works with two stacks:
- **Stack A**: initially contains all numbers
- **Stack B**: starts empty and is used as auxiliary storage

Only specific operations are allowed (swap, push, rotate, reverse rotate), and the program must output the optimal (or near-optimal) sequence of operations that sorts the stack in ascending order.

This project focuses on:
- Algorithmic thinking
- Time and space optimization
- Data structures (linked lists)
- Handling edge cases and errors
